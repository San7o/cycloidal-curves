Cycloidal curves were first conceived by RÃ¸mer (a Dane) in 1674 while
studying the best form for gear teeth. Galileo and Mersenne had
already (1599) discovered the ordinary cycloid. The beautiful double
generation theorem of these curves was first noticed by Daniel
Bernoulli in 1725. Astronomers find forms of the cycloidal curves in
various coronas. They also occur as caustics. The measuring of curve
length was given by Newton in his Principia.
